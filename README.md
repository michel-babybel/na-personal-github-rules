# Personal GitHub Rules

Just some personal rules to remind myself of.

## Repository Name

{programming_language}-{course_if_applicable}-{target_os_if_applicable}-{lower_case_name_of_project_seperated_by_hyphen}

> example: `python-project-name`

> example: `csharp-windows-my-win-application`

> example: `unity-course-code-for-the-course-im-taking`

## Commit Style

Sentence-case but no period at the end of sentence. For quick development changes just use the "Dev" commit message, otherwise just a quick general description of the changes.

> example: `Improved the thing with the thing`

> example: `Dev`

> example: `Initial commit`
